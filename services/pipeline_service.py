"""
PipelineService — executes phases as FastAPI background tasks.

Key design decisions:
- All agent execution happens here, NOT in app.py or route handlers.
- Phase status is written to DB immediately (in_progress → completed|failed).
- Background task pattern: caller fires-and-forgets; UI polls /projects/{id}.
- Phase outputs are written through StorageAdapter, never raw Path.write_text().
- All DB writes use async methods so the FastAPI event loop is never blocked.

# P26 (2026-04-25) — DAG scheduler (replaces P22's batch scheduler).
#
# User report: "struck after glr generation after some time starting fpga".
# Root cause of the perceived pause:
#
# The previous batch scheduler waited for the SLOWEST phase in each batch
# before starting the next. With Batch B = (P3, P6, P8a) and P3 depending
# on slow P2 (HRS, 10+ min in user's project), P7 — which only depends on
# P6 — could not start until P3 finished, even though P6 had been done
# for minutes.
#
# Phase-level DAG removes that artificial barrier: each phase fires the
# instant its OWN upstream deps complete. P7 starts as soon as P6 is done,
# regardless of how long P3 still needs.
#
# Dependency graph (P1 is user-driven, always done before this scheduler):
#
#   P2  (HRS)              ← P1
#   P4  (Netlist)          ← P1
#   P3  (Compliance)       ← P2, P4
#   P6  (GLR)              ← P4
#   P8a (SRS)              ← P4
#   P7  (FPGA RTL)         ← P6
#   P8b (SDD)              ← P8a
#   P7a (Register Map)     ← P7
#   P8c (Code Review)      ← P8a
#
# Two independent chains:
#   Chain A (slow): P2 → P3                  (HRS-bound critical path)
#   Chain B (fast): P4 → P6 → P7 → P7a       (parallel to chain A)
#                   P4 → P8a → P8b → P8c     (parallel to chain A)
#
# Worst-case wall time = max(Chain A, longest of Chain B variants).
# In the user's scenario where HRS is 10 min: pipeline is 10 min, not 16.
#
# UI perception is preserved by serialising the STATUS WRITES (not the
# work) in phase-id order — phase X's "completed" flag only flips after
# all earlier phase-id flags have flipped. Backend is parallel; frontend
# sidebar still appears to advance one phase at a time.

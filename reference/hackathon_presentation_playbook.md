## Speaker Notes Cheat‑Sheet (one‑liner per slide, ≈30s each)

| Slide | What to Say |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | "Good morning – we're Code Knights. Our AI‑driven Hardware Pipeline turns a 6‑12 month hardware‑software flow into a 4‑minute, error‑free experience." |
| 2 | "Engineers spend up to 80% of their time on paperwork, part searches and reviews – that's the real bottleneck, not the silicon." |
| 3 | Walk the audience through the 11 manual steps; point out where delays and re‑work happen (e.g., netlist errors discovered only after PCB layout). |
| 4 | "Large language models can read 10M+ datasheets, understand standards, and generate structured specs – the perfect tool to eliminate those manual loops." |
| 5 | "Our pipeline is an 8‑phase loop; phases 1‑4 and 6‑8 are fully automated (total < 2 min). The only human‑in‑the‑loop parts are PCB layout and FPGA coding – we'll automate those next." |
| 6 | Demo the UI: "Ask me to design a 5V power‑rail. The assistant instantly returns three compliant regulators, a generated HRS, and a netlist ready for simulation." |
| 7 | "From the netlist we auto‑produce a Glue‑Logic Requirement – a complete I/O spec that the FPGA team can copy‑paste." |
| 8 | "One click later we have driver code, a Qt GUI, unit tests, and a full static‑analysis report – all committed to Git with a PR ready for review." |
| 9 | "Live demo: we type a high‑level spec, watch the timer, and see the final driver appear. (If live is risky, swap in a short recorded clip.)" |
| 10 | "Numbers speak louder than words – see the 99% cycle‑time reduction and 85% drop in netlist errors. That's the productivity lift we're delivering today." |
| 11 | "We combine RAG for deterministic retrieval, an LLM for synthesis, and a micro‑service orchestrator for speed. All components are containerised for easy scaling." |
| 12 | "Next 12 months: plug‑in to KiCad/Altium for auto‑layout, generate Verilog from GLR, and close the verification loop with simulation‑in‑the‑loop." |
| 13 | "We've identified three main risks – stale component data, LLM hallucinations, and compliance liability – and built automated crawlers, validation layers, and audit trails to mitigate them." |
| 14 | "We invite you to partner with us, test the pipeline on your next project, and help shape the future of hardware co‑design." |

## Judges' Q&A Reference

### Problem & Market Validation
| Question | Key Points | Answer |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Why is this problem worth solving? | 60‑80% non‑value‑add time, $M cost per product, siloed tools | "Hardware teams spend 8‑10 weeks on documentation, part‑search and compliance – ≈70% of effort. In a $2B‑class market, shaving two weeks per design saves $10‑15M annually." |
| How do you know engineers struggle? | Survey / interviews with 20+ HW engineers, IEEE/McKinsey studies | "94% of our survey respondents (avg 5 yrs exp) cited component selection and spec authoring as the biggest time sink." |
| What is the addressable market? | Hardware design services ≈ $30B, TAM for design automation ≈ $4B (Gartner) | "2% of the $30B market = $600M opportunity. Niche SaaS for mid‑size firms → $50M ARR in 5 years." |

### Technical Architecture & AI
| Question | Key Points | Answer |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Why RAG + LLM, not pure LLM? | Deterministic retrieval, reduces hallucination, stays up‑to‑date | "Pure LLMs hallucinate exact spec numbers. By retrieving the exact paragraph from the datasheet and feeding it to the LLM, we guarantee factual correctness." |
| What LLM and why? | gpt‑4‑turbo, abstracted to swap Llama‑2 for on‑prem | "OpenAI gpt‑4‑turbo: best trade‑off of ≤200ms latency and industry‑grade reasoning. Code is abstracted for on‑prem Llama‑2 option." |
| How do you keep component DB fresh? | Nightly crawler for Mouser/Digi‑Key/Octopart, PDF→OCR→embeddings | "Scheduled CI job crawls top 5 distributors nightly, updates the vector store, and creates a Git‑tagged diff." |
| What guarantees correct netlist? | Derived from pin‑out tables (not hallucinated), SPICE sanity check, audit trail | "The netlist is assembled from retrieved pin‑out tables. We run a fast SPICE sanity check and flag violations before PCB." |
| How scalable is the system? | FastAPI + Celery, stateless containers, K8s, 200 concurrent req/s tested | "In our load test (200 parallel users) end‑to‑end time stayed under 5s." |

### Validation, Quality & Compliance
| Question | Key Points | Answer |
|----------|------------|--------|
| How reliable are compliance checks? | Machine‑readable rule sets, RAG pulls exact clause, human sign‑off for high‑risk | "RoHS, REACH, FCC, CE encoded as structured rule sets. Cross‑checked against selected parts. Signed PDF output." |
| MISRA‑C and security scanning? | Cppcheck + MISRA plugin, GitHub CodeQL, quality score 0‑100 | "We run Cppcheck with MISRA‑C 2023 ruleset and CodeQL for CVE detection. Any FAIL must be fixed before PR merge." |
| Real bug caught? | 3.3V I²C pull‑up + 5V regulator mismatch → auto‑fixed | "Netlist generator flagged the voltage‑level mismatch during SPICE check and auto‑re‑selected a compatible regulator." |
| IP and data privacy? | No external logs, on‑prem Docker option, privacy clause | "We never send proprietary schematics outside the customer's environment. Fully on‑prem Docker‑Compose bundle available." |

### Business Model & GTM
| Question | Key Points | Answer |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Revenue model? | SaaS tiered + pay‑per‑credit + on‑prem license | "Starter $199/mo (5 users), Pro $799/mo (20 users), Enterprise custom. Also design‑credits ($0.10/driver) and self‑hosted license." |
| Who are early adopters? | IoT startups, contract design houses, university labs | "3 pilot contracts with IoT startups ($12k ARR), university partnership for capstone projects." |
| Customer acquisition? | GitHub SDK, KiCad plug‑in, webinars, hackathon sponsorships | "Open‑source SDK drives community. KiCad plug‑in Q3 gives foot‑in‑door with PCB designers." |
| Competitive landscape? | Traditional EDA (Altium, Cadence) — no AI spec gen. Emerging tools focus on layout/RTL only. | "Our differentiator: full‑stack automation from requirements → verified netlist → driver code in minutes. We complement existing PCB tools." |

### Gotchas
| Situation | How to Phrase It |
|-----------|-----------------|
| No live demo (internet glitch) | "Our demo is captured from a real production run; timestamps show exactly how long each phase took. Same code runs on‑prem." |
| Judge asks quantitative ROI | Quote 99% cycle‑time reduction, 85% netlist‑error drop, $10M saved per 100 designs (avg $100k per design). |
| Open‑source vs proprietary | "Core RAG + component‑search: MIT‑licensed on GitHub. Proprietary: LLM orchestration + compliance rule engine." |
| Explainability | "We retrieve the exact datasheet snippet so the assistant can point to source line. Satisfies engineering audits and regulatory reviews." |
| Edge cases (exotic RF parts) | "Confidence score <0.7 → human‑in‑the‑loop surfaces top‑5 candidates. Pipeline still automates downstream docs." |

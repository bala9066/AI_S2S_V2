"""
Tests for services/pipeline_service.py — the P2→P8c auto-run executor.

Strategy:
- Patch each agent module so `execute()` returns a deterministic output
  dict, then assert on DB side-effects (phase_statuses, phase_outputs,
  conversation_history).
- Pipeline uses async session writes, so the fixture disposes the async
  engine on teardown to avoid aiosqlite ResourceWarnings (tests run with
  filterwarnings=error).

"""Regression test for P26 — netlist agent must fall back to a
BOM-derived netlist when the LLM call itself raises an exception
(not just when the LLM responds without a tool call).

User report (2026-04-25, project `gvv`):
    P4 phase_outputs.error_message =
    "All models in fallback chain failed. Last error:
     Client error '404 Not Found' for url 'http://localhost:11434/api/chat'"

Root cause: the netlist agent had a fallback path for the case where
the LLM RESPONDS WITHOUT calling `generate_netlist`, but if the LLM
call itself raised an exception (Ollama 404, network error, rate
limit, auth failure, etc.) the exception bubbled out of `await
self.call_llm(...)` and PipelineService marked the phase failed —
even though we could have built a perfectly valid netlist from
`component_recommendations.md` with no LLM at all.

Fix: wrap the `call_llm` invocation in try/except and synthesise an
empty `response = {"content": "", "tool_calls": []}` on failure so
the existing `if netlist_data: ... else:` flow takes the BOM-build
branch automatically.

"""P26 #17 (2026-04-26) — regression tests for the markdown-walker
mermaid sanitiser used by HRS / SDD / SRS / GLR agents.

These tests use the EXACT bug strings that broke the in-browser
preview on project rx_band so the regression coverage is concrete:

  L257 of HRS:  `MIX2["..."]}` — extra `}` after rect close
  L1540 of HRS: `LDO5C["+5V_CH[1:4]..."]` — nested `[1:4]` inside a
                quoted label that confuses mermaid's parser

The contract: feed a markdown document with a malformed mermaid
block in → get back the same markdown with the fenced block
replaced by a coerce + re-render pass. Other markdown content
(headings, prose, code fences in OTHER languages) is left
untouched.

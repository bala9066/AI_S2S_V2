"""
Banned manufacturers + obsolete / NRND part rules — P1.5.

The requirements_agent system prompt lists these in natural language
("BANNED MANUFACTURER: VPT Inc.", obsolete HMC-series patterns, etc.).
The LLM is expected to respect them, but nothing enforces it. That's
unsafe for a defence-grade pipeline — a hallucinated part number can
still slip through.

This module codifies those rules so they're applied as a **hard filter**
on every `component_recommendations` payload before it reaches the BOM:

    kept, rejected = filter_components(bom_list)

Rejected components come back with a `_rejection_reason` key so the
audit report can surface them.

Keeping the rules as data (two frozensets + a regex list) makes them
trivial to extend — no agent prompt-tuning required.
